# README

A rails app showcasing user authentication and profile management. Devise is
installed but not customized. Localization of the app is incomplete but
demonstrates the usefullness of a user profile modeled outside of the Devise
user model. The result is the start of an app that's a little easier to manage
compared to storing profile data in the users table and customizing Devise.

## Getting started

    bundle install
    rails s
